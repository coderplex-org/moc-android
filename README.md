### Project Structure
Try to follow guidelines laid in [Project Structure](https://github.com/fcc-hyd/moc-android/blob/master/projectStructure.md) for organizing your repositories.

### Assignments
Projects are broken down to :
- [Personal Assignments](https://github.com/fcc-hyd/moc-android/projects) : Candidates are required to submit them regularly to advance in the course. [Personal projects tracker](https://github.com/fcc-hyd/moc-android/blob/master/progressTracker.md) is displays each candidates assignment completion.
- Group Projects :
All the candidates contribute to these projects.

### Best Practices
- Upload your photos to [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) for sharing adding them in markdown files in projects.
- Instead of uploading the complete android project, its a good idea to include the [.apk](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17702053/where-is-android-studio-building-my-apk-file) file and relevant code files.
- Send only one commit pull request per project, Stagging multiple commits in one pull request will be rejected.
- Fetch latest updates from the master before working to avoid conflicts later on.

### Course Expectations
1. Learn & create professional quality Android apps which :
    - Authenticates user through Google, Github etc.
    - Follows material design guidelines for professional UI/UX
    - Runs smoothly within limited memory
    - Sends & receives information from web APIs.
    - Stores relevant data locally for quick access.
2. Test apps for production use.
3. Publish apps on playstore.

### Prerequisites
Enrolling candidates should be motivated to learn and be comfortable with at least one programming language. Preference will be given to candidates who can code in Java. Familiarity with Git is also expected. Access to an Android device is helpful, but not mandatory.

### Study schedule
Enrolled candidates are expected to dedicate 5 to 7 hours everyday for this track.
