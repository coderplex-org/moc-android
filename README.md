# Android - Month of Code Jun'17
# FreeCodeCamp - Hyderabad

## Project Structure
Try to follow guidelines laid in [Project Structure](https://github.com/fcc-hyd/moc-android/blob/master/projectStructure.md) for organizing your repositories.

## Assignments
Projects are broken down to :
- [Personal Assignments](https://github.com/fcc-hyd/moc-android/projects) : Candidates are required to submit them regularly to advance in the course. [Personal projects tracker](https://github.com/fcc-hyd/moc-android/blob/master/progressTracker.md) is displays each candidates assignment completion.
- Group Projects :
All the candidates contribute to these projects.

### Best Practices
- Upload your photos to [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) for sharing adding them in markdown files in projects.
- Instead of uploading the complete android project, its a good idea to include the [.apk](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17702053/where-is-android-studio-building-my-apk-file) file and relevant code files.

### Course Expectations
1. Learn & create professional quality Android apps which :
    - Authenticates user through Google, Github etc.
    - Follows material design guidelines for professional UI/UX
    - Runs smoothly within limited memory
    - Sends & receives information from web APIs.
    - Stores relevant data locally for quick access.
2. Test apps for production use.
3. Publish apps on playstore.

## Syllabus
This program is structured and tailed around each candidates depending upon various parameters. Although not required to follow exactly, a flexible [Syllabus](https://github.com/fcc-hyd/moc-android/blob/master/syllabus.md) is created.
